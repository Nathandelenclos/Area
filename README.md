# [B-DEV-500] AREA

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for
The goal of this project is to discover, as a whole, the software platform that you have chosen through the
creation of a business application.
To do this, you must implement a software suite that functions similar to that of IFTTT and/or Zapier.
This software suite will be broken into three parts :

- An **application server** to implement all the features listed below (see Features)
- A **web client** to use the application from your browser by querying the **application server**
- A **mobile client** to use the application from your phone by querying the **application server**
